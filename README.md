## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Fast JavaScript runtime and package
  manager
- **Frontend**: [Preact](https://preactjs.com) + TypeScript +
  [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- **Backend**: Vercel Functions with Bun runtime
- **PDF Generation**: [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) +
  [@sparticuz/chromium](https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium)
- **Validation**:
  [botc-script-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botc-script-checker)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (v1.x)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server (frontend + backend + package watch)
bun run dev

# Run type checking
bun run typecheck

# Build for production
bun run build
```

The dev server runs:

- Frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API at `http://localhost:3001`

## Deployment

The project deploys to Vercel automatically:

- **Production**: Push to `main` branch
- **Preview**: Push to any other branch or open a PR

Vercel configuration is in `vercel.json`. The serverless function uses Bun
runtime (`bunVersion: "1.x"`).

## View generated HTML file

This project, edited by Todd Nguyen-Tran, will generate HTML files. You can then edit the HTML file however you want. Say you want the Marionette to be replaced by the Poisoner token. You can do that by finding the ">Marionette<" text and replace it with ">Marionette (Poisoner token)<".

After the HTML is generated and downloaded, move it to [/frontend/public/html/](/frontend/public/html/) folder. Create that folder if it does not exist. Then, view the file at (if your port is 5173): http://localhost:5173/html/YourScript.html.

If you view the HTML file with Google Chrome or any Chromium browser, you can then Print to PDF as you'd like. Remember to enable "Background Graphics" for the beautiful background created by [JohnForster](https://github.com/JohnForster).

## Script Format

Scripts are JSON arrays following the
[official BotC schema](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Script_Metadata):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "_meta",
    "name": "My Custom Script",
    "author": "Your Name"
  },
  "washerwoman",
  "imp",
  {
    "id": "custom_character",
    "name": "Custom Character",
    "team": "townsfolk",
    "ability": "Your ability text here..."
  }
]
```

Characters can be:

- Official character IDs (lowercase strings like `"washerwoman"`)
- Full character objects with `id`, `name`, `team`, and `ability`

## Fonts

- **Title**: "Unlovable" by Letterhead Fonts
- **Character names**: Goudy Old Style
- **Abilities**: Trade Gothic / Asap Condensed

## Note on Use of LLMs

This project was developed with assistance from Claude (Anthropic). While the
project was architected by and largely written by hand, LLMs were used with
close supervision for:

- **Code generation**: Filling out components, serverless functions, and build
  configurations
- **Documentation**: Writing inline code comments
- **Refactoring**

All LLM-generated code was reviewed and modified by the developer before being
committed.
